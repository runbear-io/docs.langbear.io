## Setup your development

Learn how to setup LangBear locally and deploy them to the public.

### Add LangBear to your project

Step 1. Add LangBear dependency to your project:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install langbear
```

```bash npm
npm install -S langbear
```

```bash yarn
yarn add langbear
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add langbear
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Initialize LangBear instance:

<CodeGroup>

```python python
from langbear import LangBear

lb = LangBear(end_point="http://localhost:3030")
```

```typescript typescript
TBD;
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Add LangBear hook to your LangChain callbacks:

<CodeGroup>

```python python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

callback_handler = lb.llm_callback_handler()
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.5, callbacks=[callback_handler])
```

```typescript typescript
TBD;
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 3. Get a prompt template from LangBear:

<CodeGroup>

```python python
prompt = lb.get_prompt_template("company-name-generation")
prompt.format(product="colorful socks")
```

```typescript typescript
TBD;
```

</CodeGroup>

## Run LangBear application

Step 1. Clone LangBear application:

<Note>
  Check out
  [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
  page for more details about cloning a repository.
</Note>

```bash
git clone git@github.com:runbear-io/langbear-app.git
```

Step 2. Go to the LangBear application directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm dev
```

The LangBear application is now available at `http://localhost:3030`.

### Custom ports

LangBear application uses port 3030 by default. You can use the `PORT` environment variable to customize the port LangBear application runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
PORT=3333 npm dev
```
