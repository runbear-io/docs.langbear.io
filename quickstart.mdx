## Running LangBear application

The LangBear app is a web application for prompt management. Users can create
and update prompt templates on-the-fly, track versions, and monitor prompt
ratings with it.

Step 1. Create and configure a new LangBear app with Supabase.

```bash
$ npx create-langbear-app my-app --database supabase
```

Step 2. Start your app with `npm run dev`.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

The LangBear application is now available at `http://localhost:3030`. Check
out the [Application Setup](/application/setup) page for more details.

## Setting up your development

The LangBear library allows you to manage LangChain prompts from the LangBear
web application, accomplished with just a few lines of code.

Step 1. Add LangBear dependency to your project:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install langbear
```

```bash npm
npm install -S langbear
```

```bash yarn
yarn add langbear
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add langbear
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Initialize LangBear instance:

<CodeGroup>

```python python
from langbear import LangBear

lb = LangBear(end_point="http://localhost:3030")
```

```typescript typescript
TBD;
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Add LangBear hook to your LangChain callbacks:

<CodeGroup>

```python python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

callback_handler = lb.llm_callback_handler()
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.5, callbacks=[callback_handler])
```

```typescript typescript
TBD;
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 3. Get a prompt template from LangBear:

<CodeGroup>

```python python
prompt = lb.get_prompt_template("company-name-generation")
prompt.format(product="colorful socks")
```

```typescript typescript
TBD;
```

</CodeGroup>
