While Language Learning Models (LLMs) support content generation in various languages,
supplying prompts in different languages enhances the user experience.

## Adding prompts in different languages

TODO: Screenshot here.

## Getting prompts for a specific language

Pass `lang` as a parameter to the `get_prompt_template` function.

<CodeGroup>

```python python
prompt = lb.get_prompt_template("company-name-generation", lang="fr")
```

```typescript typescript
TBD;
```

</CodeGroup>

Default language will be used if `lang` is not specified.
