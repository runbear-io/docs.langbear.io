Few-shot examples in Language Learning Models (LLMs) provide the model with a few task
examples, guiding its predictions. Incorporated directly into the input, they help the
model understand and respond accurately to new or complex tasks.

## Adding few-shot examples

Visit the `Few-shot examples` page to add few-shot examples.

TODO: Screenshot here.

## Setting up few-shot examples to be used in a prompt template

Attach the few-shot examples to a prompt template.

TODO: Screenshot here.

## Getting a prompt with few-shot examples

Few-shot examples will be included in the prompt returned by the `get_prompt_template`.

<CodeGroup>

```python python
prompt = lb.get_prompt_template("company-name-generation")
```

```typescript typescript
TBD;
```

</CodeGroup>

## Using an example selector

You can pass an example selector to the `get_prompt_template` method to select the
few-shot examples to be included in the prompt.

<Note>
  Check out [Using an example
  selector](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/few_shot_examples#using-an-example-selector)
  section to learn more about example selectors.

<CodeGroup>

```python python
from langchain.prompts.example_selector import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.from_examples(
  [], # Keep it empty. The examples will be set by LangBear.
  OpenAIEmbeddings(),
  Chroma,
  k=1
)

prompt = lb.get_prompt_template(
  "company-name-generation",
  example_selector=example_selector
)
```

```typescript typescript
