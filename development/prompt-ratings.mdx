## Getting the prompt request key

To save a prompt rating, you need to know the prompt request key. This key
is returned when you call the `Prompts#get` method:

<CodeGroup>

```python python
prompt = lb.prompts.get("company-name-generation")
prompt_reqeust_key = prompt.request_key
```

```typescript typescript
TBD;
```

</CodeGroup>

## Saving prompt ratings

To save a prompt rating, call the `save` method on the `Ratings` object:

<CodeGroup>

```python python
lb.ratings.save(
  request_key=prompt_request_key,
  rating=0.5,                       # between 0.0 and 1.0
  metadata={"key": "value"},        # optional
)
```

```typescript typescript
TBD;
```

</CodeGroup>
